We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
					<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

								<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
					<p>Like most website operators, Potato Fintech collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Potato Fintech's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Potato Fintech's visitors use its website. From time to time, Potato Fintech may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
					<p>Potato Fintech also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://cs3382.cs.cityu.edu.hk/kwokctse2/Potato-Fintech blog posts. Potato Fintech only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
					
								<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
					<p>Certain visitors to Potato Fintech's websites choose to interact with Potato Fintech in ways that require Potato Fintech to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Potato Fintech gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://cs3382.cs.cityu.edu.hk/kwokctse2/Potato-Fintech to provide a username and email address.</p>
					
								<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

					<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Potato Fintech discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Potato Fintech believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Potato Fintech, third parties or the public at large.</p>
					<p>If you are a registered user of http://cs3382.cs.cityu.edu.hk/kwokctse2/Potato-Fintech and have supplied your email address, Potato Fintech may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Potato Fintech and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
